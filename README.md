#### Topic: Commodity Data Center Network Arch

Today’s data centers may contain tens of thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. [1] In our teamwork, we simulated a special data center topology: Fat-Tree and applied its routing algorithm. Also we applied flow classification and flow rearrangement on this data center topology. Then, we found the Fat-Tree structure also have some drawbacks, which impelled us to find more new structures and new algorithms. We raise an overview of several future perspectives, like combining Fat-Tree structure and BCube structure.



We cannot possibly finish this project if we did not receive Professor Shyam Parekh’s project reference, and we are grateful for his wonderful course this semester. 
Our programming language is Python (3.5.2), 64bit. The coding environment is Windows 10.
